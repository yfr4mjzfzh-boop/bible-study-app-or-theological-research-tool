Redemption was purchased by Christ's blood. Out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation - the elect are gathered from all humanity. Christ's death has secured a multitude that no man can number from every tribe and language."

Neither sorrow, nor crying, nor pain - all effects of the curse removed. Former things are passed away - the old order of suffering and sin is gone forever. This is our hope: eternal joy in God's presence."

Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take freely. Salvation is offered to all without money and without price. Let all who thirst for righteousness come to Christ and drink. The invitation is universal; the gift is free."
